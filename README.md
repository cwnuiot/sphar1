# CWNU-MRD
The research team has collected the tag response feature data of twenty-one human activities with the largest number in the bound-RFID HAR so far, thus obtaining the human activity dataset CWNU-RDA based on the body RFID skeleton. The twenty-one human activities include the posturechanging activity and the postural-constant activity. There are seventeen kinds of posture-changing activities, such as "standing to crouching," "crouching to standing," "standing to stooping," "standing and stooping," and so on. Some of these activities are quite similar, such as "stride away with swinging arms" and "stride away without swinging arms." The posturalconstant activity includes "standing," "sitting," "crouching" and "lying." The dataset which reflects the polymorphism of human activity is beneficial to improve the generalization ability of HAR model.
