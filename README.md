2. Data collection environment

Devices：

                Reader：Impinj R420

                Antenna：Larid S9028PCR

                Tag：Impinj M4E

Ground：

                3.5m (length) × 3.2m (width) × 4.5m (height)

Volunteers:

     This research team recruited 3 volunteers. Each volunteer repeated each human activity 40 times, and each completed human activity is an activity sample. The time to complete an activity sample is also known as the human activity duration, and the duration was reasonably set to 5 seconds.

3. An example of data

     Each tag response record in the dataset includes the EPC, timestamp, Dopler Frequency, RSSI, Phase, and the activity number (label) used to identify the activity.
